## About Example My Own Identity Provider

We use the flowing packages and tools to develop the IdP:

- [Passport Package](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/passport): Authentication package
- [Sail Package](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail): Development environment with Docker and PHP 8.2 runtime, MySQL
- [Breeze Package](https://github.com/laravel/breeze)

## Preparation

Setup your environment and install required packages

1. Install laravel passport

```shell
# Install with native composer
composer require laravel/passport

# Install with sail and docker
sail composer require laravel/passport
```

2. Run migration
   First and foremost, you must run the default migration if you want to utilize the default database structure provided
   by `laravel/passport`

```shell
# With native
php artisan migrate

# With sail
sail php artisan migrate
```

3. Install passport

This command will create the encryption keys necessary for generating secure access tokens and will also create
'personal access' and 'password grant' clients used for generating access tokens.
We use the `--uuids` option to employ Client UUIDs instead of auto-increment IDs.

The secret and public key will store in `storage` path with name `oauth-private.key` and `oauth-public.key`

```shell
# With native
php artisan passport:install --uuids

# With sail
sail php artisan passport:install --uuids
```

4. Add the Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens trait to your App\Models\User model.

```php
<?php
 
namespace App\Models;
 
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;
 
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;
}
```

5. Set up token lifetimes

To dynamically set up token lifetimes, we need to add additional key configurations to passport.php.

```php
'token_lifetimes' => [
    'tokens' => env('TOKEN_LIFETIMES', 2*60*60), // Unit seconds
    'refresh_tokens' => env('REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIMES', 4*60*60), // Unit seconds
    'personal_access_token' => env('ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIMES', 24*60*60), // Unit seconds
]
```

Then, we need to register the configuration in the `boot` method of Class `App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`

```php
/**
 * Register any authentication / authorization services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Passport::tokensExpireIn(now()->addSeconds(config('passport.token_lifetimes.tokens')));
    Passport::refreshTokensExpireIn(now()->addSeconds(config('passport.token_lifetimes.refresh_tokens')));
    Passport::personalAccessTokensExpireIn(
        now()->addSeconds(config('passport.token_lifetimes.personal_access_token'))
    );
}
```

### Create example User

Using tinker and create an example user

```php
\App\Models\User::query()->create([
        'email' => 'example@gmail.com',
        'password' => '123455667',
        'name' => 'example',
        'email_verified_at' => now()
    ])
```

## OpenId Connect

The instructions above help you integrate `laravel\passport` into a Laravel project.

Let's continue and gather some information about OpenID Connect.

[OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

This specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use
of Claims to communicate information about the End-User.

It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.

## How to implement with passport?

Next, We dive into how to implement the IdP with `laravel/passport`.

### Authentication flow

OpenID Connect supports 3 main Authentication flow:

- [Authorization Code Flow](./docs/AUTHORIZATION-FLOW.MD)
- [Implicit Flow](./docs/IMPLICIT-FLOW.MD)
- [Hybrid Flow](./docs/HYBRID-FLOW.MD)

### Single Sign-On
- [Single Sign On](docs/SSO.MD)

## Key Points to Note
- The Authorization Server is responsible for centrally managing user information and providing authentication methods
  on this server
- To integrate with the Authorization Server, it is essential to provide methods for clients to generate client_id and
  client_secret. Additionally, you should provide clients with the means to independently manage user accounts for each
  client. This means that the same username can create two accounts on two different clients.
- By default, Passport checks the login status of users based on sessions.
- By default, Passport support some grant types: 
  - Authorization Code 
  - Refresh Token 
  - Password 
  - Personal Access Token 
  - Client Credential 
  - Implicit Grant

## Advantages of Laravel Passport
- Fully supports integration with the OAuth2 protocol in many ways.

## Disadvantages of Laravel Passport
- It hasn't supported Social login and SSO login yet. You need to develop your own solution.

## Error Checking
- [ ] Firstly, Need to register client and user account
- [ ] The redirect_uri must match the redirect URL that was specified when the client was created.
- [ ] Define the way user can authenticate own account

## Next?
Try to figure out how to customize and implement the Single Sign-On (SSO) login and Social login, and integrate them into the authentication process.
